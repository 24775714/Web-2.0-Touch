## Web 2.0 TouchJava Script mini framework for Touch devices (iPhone, iPad, Android and other webkit compatible). I have originally started with jqTouch, but soon found it to be limited in features I watned to have and ease of use. ## InstallationDownload and install all files, open index.php in the mobile browser. You are good to get rolling. This mini framework uses 2 open source libaries:* jQuery* iScroll## Resourses* [http://web20boom.com/touch](http://web20boom.com/touch) - home page (video demo is here)* [http://web20boom.com/demo/touch](http://web20boom.com/demo/touch) - demo (open on iPhone)
